# Learning Golang using [Go by Examples](https://gobyexample.com/)

## Get the Code
Clone the Project: `git clone <LINK>`

## Run the Project
Run the main.go file to see output: `go run hello-world.go`

or rebuild the project with: `go build hello-world.go`
and then run the built version: `./hello-world`

Note: If you are building you will need to rebuild the file everytime you make changes 

Learning-Golang-by-Examples
This repository contains examples of Go programs that demonstrate various concepts in the Go language. Each file represents a different section of learning material.

Files
first-four-section.go
This file demonstrates basic Go syntax and features such as variables, constants, and control structures (like loops and conditionals). It includes examples of arithmetic operations, boolean expressions, and variable declarations.

fifth-ninth-section.go
This file introduces more advanced topics such as functions and the switch statement. It includes examples of function declaration, function calls, and the use of switch statements for conditional execution.

Running the Code
To run the code in these files, navigate to the directory containing the files and run the following commands:

go run first-four-section.go
go run fifth-ninth-section.go
Note: These files are meant to be run separately. They each contain a main function, which is the entry point for a standalone executable program. Running them together would require refactoring the code to extract the common functionality into separate functions that can be called from a single main function.
